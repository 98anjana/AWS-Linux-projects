# Overview of Architecture

We will use the following AWS services:
* AWS Lambda: To run PHP code serverlessly.
* Amazon API Gateway: To route HTTP requests to Lambda functions.
* Amazon Aurora Serverless: As a managed, serverless MySQL-compatible database.
* Amazon S3: To store and serve media files.
* Amazon CloudFront: For content delivery and caching.
