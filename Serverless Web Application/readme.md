* ### What Is Serverless ?

  Serverless is a cloud computing model where you don't need to manage servers to run your applications. In this model, the cloud provider (like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud) automatically provisions, scales, and manages the infrastructure required to run your code. Instead of worrying about servers, you only focus on writing the application logic.
